# Graphtograph

## 📌 Project Overview
**Graphtograph** is a comprehensive solution for graph-based data analysis and visualization, leveraging advanced machine learning models to extract insights from complex data structures. This project provides an interactive interface to perform graph processing tasks, generate visual representations, and uncover hidden patterns in data.

## 🚀 Features
- Graph construction and visualization
- Node and edge analysis
- Community detection algorithms
- Pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, A* Search, etc.)
- Graph-based anomaly detection
- Real-time interactive visualization with Streamlit

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- NetworkX
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- MI2RLNet
- MedPy

## 🔑 Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
